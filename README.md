# Roll Your Own Framework

Sometimes your project just needs a basic starting point and not a 10.000 files monster of a framework. ryof aims to provide such a starting point.

## Usage

Clone this repo and delete the `.git/` directory.

To serve your project during development you can use PHP's built-in web server:

```sh
php -S localhost:8080 --docroot=public/ public/index.php
```
